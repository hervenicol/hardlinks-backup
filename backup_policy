Create rsync backups
Keep old versions using hard links

Interesting info/help:

Policy:
- Keep a version per year. 
	Name: [backup_name].year.[YYYY]
	Done during december. Not 31/12, too late in case of problem. Let's say 10/12.
	command: cp -al [current] [YYYY backup]
		Check if dir exists before
- Keep 3 last months (01 of month)
	Name: [backup_name].month.[month_name]
	command: find path -name [backup_name].month.* --depth 1 --ctime +100 --exec rm {} \; && cp -al [current] [backup_name].month.[month_name]
- Keep 4 last weeks (monday)
	Name: [backup_name].week.{4..1}
	command: delete 4, move 3 to 4 ... 1 to 2, cp -al [backup_name] to 1
- Update current backup every day.
	Name: [backup_name]



Notes:

- create lock system for mount ro/rw:
	each process that asks for rw puts a lock with its PID
	each process that asks for ro removes its lock
	when there the last lock is removed, we can effectively remount ro
=> create functions / a lib to handle this.

Don't forget checks for dir [ -d xxx ] before trying to overwrite / cp / mv ...
